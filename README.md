# D365-UI-Test Designer

This is an extension for providing a user interface for writing UI Tests for Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement.
It can capture your page actions and assist you in defining actions and assertions for your tests.

The test suite that you create can be exported (and imported again). In addition to this, the extension can create a fully functioning D365-UI-Test UI Test script, which you can use for executing directly in D365-UI-Test.

D365-UI-Test can be found here: https://github.com/XRM-OSS/D365-UI-Test
There you can also find a reference to sample UI Test project, which you can use as base for pasting and running the exported auto generated UI Tests.
